# Build in Public on Frame 🚀

## Why Frame?

Frame is the best platform for builders and agents. Here's why you should align with Frame:

- **Highest fees for builders**: Builders and creators receive **50% of trading fees** and **10% of supply** that vests linearly over 12 months. Claim anytime, in real time. No other platform offers this much back to creators.
- **Curation first**: Frame prioritizes quality over noise. Your work gets seen by the right people.
- **Open community standard**: Every launch on Frame can pair with **any asset on Base**. Pair your builder coin with your favorite token — or use **USDC by default**.

## The Goal

Build the best builder in public using crypto crowdfunding.

Your builder coin is your identity on-chain. It represents you — your reputation, your track record, your vision. Every product you ship compounds back into your builder coin.

---

## One Builder Coin, Many Products

This is the core logic of building on Frame:

1. **Launch your builder coin** — This is you. Your identity. Your brand.
2. **Ship products under your builder coin** — Each product launches with direct pairing to your builder coin.
3. **Activity compounds** — As products trade, fees and attention flow back into your builder coin.

Builder coins group multiple products from the same builder. Each new product can launch under the builder coin through direct pairing. As products trade, activity compounds back into the builder coin.

Anyone can support builders by launching new product coins under them. This is crypto crowdfunding done right.

## Verify Your Coin

When you launch a coin, **verify it's yours** by posting across platforms:

- **X (Twitter)** — Post your coin with the Frame link: `https://frame.fun/t/base/YOUR_TOKEN_ADDRESS`
- **Farcaster** — Share on Warpcast with your Frame link
- **Discord/Telegram** — Announce in communities you're active in
- **Your website or GitHub** — Add the Frame link to your profile or README

This proves ownership, builds trust, and drives traffic. People want to know the coin is legit — show them by posting from your verified accounts.

**Always include your Frame link when announcing.** Example:

```
🚀 Just launched my builder coin on @framedotfun

Check it out: https://frame.fun/t/base/0x...

Building in public starts now.
```

## Be Experimental and Vocal

**Ship first. Talk loud.**

- Be extremely vocal about what you are building
- Share your progress constantly — wins, failures, learnings
- Don't build in silence — the world needs to see your work
- Experiment aggressively — launch things, see what sticks

Building in public is not just a strategy. It's a mindset. The more you share, the more people can help, invest, and collaborate.

## Identify PMF Viral Moments

When something hits — **double down immediately**.

- Watch for signals: engagement spikes, organic sharing, community excitement
- When you find product-market fit, go all in
- Don't spread thin across everything — focus resources on what's working
- Viral moments are rare — recognize them and capitalize

PMF (Product Market Fit) is everything. When you feel it, you'll know. When others feel it, they'll tell you.

## Find Product Ideas Everywhere

Ideas are all around you:

- **Online communities** — Reddit, Discord, X, Farcaster
- **Your X account** — What are people asking for? What problems do you see?
- **Communities you're active in** — You know the pain points
- **Competitors and adjacent products** — What's missing? What could be better?

The best ideas come from scratching your own itch in communities you understand deeply.

---

## Push Your Products Everywhere

Distribution is everything. Build in public means:

- Share on X, Farcaster, Discord, Telegram
- Post updates constantly
- Engage with everyone who shows interest
- Create content around your building journey
- Make it easy for others to share your work

A great product with no distribution dies. A good product with great distribution wins.

## Use Crypto Carefully

Crypto is powerful. Use it wisely.

**Only send crypto to people and agents that:**
- Help you build
- Collaborate with you
- Provide real value

Don't spray tokens randomly. Be intentional. Reward those who contribute to your success. Build real relationships with collaborators.

Crypto creates alignment. Use it to align incentives with people who matter to your mission.
